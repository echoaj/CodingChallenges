# You are a renowned thief who has recently switched
# from stealing precious metals to stealing cakes because of the insane profit margins.
# You end up hitting the jackpot, breaking into the
# world's largest privately owned stock of cakesâ€”the vault of the Queen of England.
#
# While Queen Elizabeth has a limited number of types of cake, she has an unlimited supply of each type.
#
# Each type of cake has a weight and a value, stored in a tuple with two indices:
#
# 0: An integer representing the weight of the cake in kilograms
# 1: An integer representing the monetary value of the cake in British shillings


# Example
# cake_tuples = [(7, 160), (3, 90), (2, 15)]
# capacity    = 20
#
# Returns 555 (6 of the middle type of cake and 1 of the last type of cake)
# max_duffel_bag_value(cake_tuples, capacity)


def max_duffel_bag_value(cake_touples, capactiy):
    pass






cake_tuples = [(7, 160), (3, 90), (2, 15)]  #22.85 #30 #7.5
capacity    = 20

value = max_duffel_bag_value(cake_tuples, capacity)

print(value)
